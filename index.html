          Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. Batman originated from an incident in Bruce's childhood; after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.

              The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or
              "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times,
              literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, Natura is
              mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis
              (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics
              that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of
              their own accord.
            </p>
            <p class="font-italic d-block">
              &quot;Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often
              refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general
              realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the
              processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that
              particular types of things exist and change of their own accord,
              such as the weather and geology of the Earth.&quot;

                  The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the
                  ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is
                  held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen,
                  water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide,
                  argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with
                  altitude. The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting
                  the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the
                  surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to
                  protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat
                  during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature
                  extremes.

                  Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes
                  in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can
                  expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce
                  devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on
                  the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes
                  lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on
                  the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth
                  for their food. Climate is a measure of the long-term trends
                  in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the
                  climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse
                  gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the
                  Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known
                  to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past,
                  including ice ages.

                  Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and
                  oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.[29] In
                  typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state,
                  but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous
                  state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's
                  surface.[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other
                  large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in
                  aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and
                  precipitation.[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water,
                  glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface
                  water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a
                  minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within
                  biological bodies and manufactured products.

                  Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

                  An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.[33][34] This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.

                  Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.[26] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.

                  A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.

                  A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide. Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.

                  Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way.[41] The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.

                  Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.

                  The biosphere is the part of Earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013 kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.
